* We were able to pull all of the data using python and able to display the data we need in terminal. The problem that we had was displaying the python variables that stored out data and display them on the webpage. We didn't include the actual code for the web page because it would just be a simple html, css, and javascript code that didn't do anything except a drop down bar with a submit button on it. Reflecting on our mistakes, we should have reached out to you guys for a solution to our issue and will be more attentive to our issues.
